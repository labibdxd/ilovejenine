    Happy New Year, my love 🤍<br><br>
    As this new year begins, I just want you to know how grateful I am to have you in my life.
    You made my days brighter, my nights calmer and my heart happier in ways I never knew were possible.
    Every smile of yours feels like a promise that everything will be okay.<br><br>
    I hope this year brings us more laughter, more late night talks, more silly moments,
    more gandmasti, more akam (yk), and countless memories together.<br><br>
    No matter what the new year brings, I want to face it with you hand in hand,
    heart to heart.<br><br>
    <strong>I LOVE YOU SO MUCH JENINE</strong>
